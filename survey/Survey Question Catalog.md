# Survey Question Catalog

This is a supplementary file for the paper submission "It might be balanced, but is it actually good? 
An Empirical Evaluation of Game Level Balancing" to the IEEE Conference on Games 2024.

The file is the catalog of the questions (items) and possible answers of the conducted survey. After each question, we indicate 
in brackets the name of the item used in the paper. The name of the item was not shown to the participants.
The catalog is structured as follows: the questions regarding the first played version and the questions related 
to the second level version. Each version includes three questions regarding both the player and the opponent. For a
better formatting, you may want to open the file as a Markdown file.
